# Cloudflare Pages configuration for Bunoraa 🔧
# Minimal Pages-compatible config: includes project name and build output directory only.

name = "bunoraa"

[vars]
# Use an existing settings module that works during builds; change if needed
DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE = "core.settings.s3"

# For build commands (install deps / collectstatic), configure them in the Pages project
# settings in the Cloudflare dashboard or via the CLI rather than in this file.
# If you need Worker deployment, create a separate `wrangler.worker.toml` with Worker-specific
# fields (name, type, account_id, zone_id, route, compatibility_date, etc.).
